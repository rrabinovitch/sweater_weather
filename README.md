# Sweater Weather
**Built by Ruthie Rabinovitch**: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ruthie-r/), [Turing alumni portfolio](https://alumni.turing.io/alumni/ruthie-rabinovitch)

This repo serves as a solo, [final project](https://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/sweater_weather/) for Module 3 of [Turing School of Software & Design's Back-End program](https://backend.turing.io/). The submission of this project entailed a techincal presentation including a live demo and discussion regarding of code organization as well as happy and sad path test coverage.  

Sweater Weather is the back-end of a hypothetical application for planning road trips. The app allows users to see the current weather as well as the forecasted weather at their destination. This repo exposes the API that satisfies the (hypothetical) front-end teamâ€™s requirements.

To follow OOP principles, this project uses a facade design pattern and also implements POROs - yielding skinnier controllers and DRYer code, better following SPR, and only sending objects to serializers.

## Learning Goals
* Expose an API that aggregates data from multiple external APIs:
   * _`road trip` endpoint aggregates data from three third party end points ([MapQuest geocoding API](https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/geocoding-api/), [MapQuest directions API](https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/directions-api/), and [OpenWeather OneCall API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api)_
   * _`forecast` endpoint aggregates data from two third party endpoints ([MapQuest geocoding API](https://developer.mapquest.com/documentation/geocoding-api/) and [OpenWeather OneCall API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api))_
* Expose an API that requires an authentication token: _`roadtrip` endpoint requires API key included in request body_
* Expose an API for CRUD functionality: _`users` endpoint creates User records_
* Determine completion criteria based on the needs of other developers: _each issue in my [project board](https://github.com/rrabinovitch/sweater_weather/projects/1?fullscreen=true) outlines implementation details and includes screenshots of relevant info provided by the "front end"_
* Research, select, and consume an API based on your needs as a developer: _[Pexels API](https://www.pexels.com/api/?locale=en-US) selected for `backgrounds` endpoint_

## Future Iterations
* Implement sad path conditions and testing for `forecast` and `road trip` endpoints when location, origin, or destination information cannot be found and when entered using unrecognizable format
* DRY up `RoadTripsController` and `SessionsController` error message conditionals
* [Background image extension](https://github.com/rrabinovitch/sweater_weather/projects/1#card-46078542)

## Local Setup
**Version Requirements**
* ruby 2.5.3
* rails 5.2

1. `git clone git@github.com:rrabinovitch/sweater_weather.git`
2. `cd sweater_weather`
3. `bundle install`
4. `rails db:{create,migrate}
5. `figaro install` (this will generate a gitignored `config/application.yml` file)
6. obtain API keys from the following services:
    * [MapQuest](https://developer.mapquest.com/plan_purchase/steps/business_edition/business_edition_free/register)
    * [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/appid)
    * [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/api/?locale=en-US) (click 'Get Started')
6. add the API keys you obtained to `application.yml`:
    ```
    MAPQUEST_API_KEY: <your mapquest key>
    OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY: <your openweather key>
    PEXELS_API_KEY: <your pexels key>
    ```
7. run `rails s` and explore the endpoints below!
8. run the test suite: `bundle exec rspec`

## Endpoints

* responses are JSON API 1.0 Compliant
* GET requests require params submitted via query params
* POST requests require params submitted via the request body
* make sure to follow the local set up instructions above and run `rails s` before consuming these endpoints

  * time: Unix UTC format
  * humidity: percentage
  * visitbility: meters
  * precipitation: millimeters (combined value of rain and snow)
